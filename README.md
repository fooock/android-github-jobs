# Github Jobs
Application to show the current opened jobs from [Github jobs](https://jobs.github.com/). You 
can view and filter jobs by country, company name, title etc using the powerful search engine.

Technically, this application was developed using MVP architecture, divided in three 
modules:
* **app**: Android views, navigation, activities and fragments. If you want to contribute 
to the look & feel, you need touch this module
* **domain**: All business logic lives here!
* **data**: Manage persistence, to allow offline mode and fast data recovery. 

If you want to compile the application yourself see below.

## Building the application
First clone the project:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/fooock/android-github-jobs.git
```
Now, build the application in debug mode to generate the `apk` :
```sh
gradlew app:assembleDebug
```
If you want to know the current application version, you can execute the gradle task `printVersion`
which produces an output similar to the following:
```sh
+----------------------------------
| Version Name: 0.1-89-g27c749b
| Version Code: 1
| Version Code Time: 1517590824
+----------------------------------
```
> **Important!**
> If you find any bug, please attach this info in the issue tracker. For this example, the 
number `g27c749b` is the commit identifier, and it will allow me to do a checkout, create a new 
branch and upload the fix.

The application has two build types, and each one initialize things required for the given
case. For example, the *[debug](app/src/debug/java/com/fooock/github/jobs/DefaultApplication.java)* build type, initialize among other things:
* Log debug tree using `Timber` . This allows us print **only** in debug mode logs with `DEBUG` and `INFO`
tags, because normally, this logs can't be needed in release builds
* `LeakCanary` library, to look for memory leaks, and fix it!
* Database inspection using `Stetho`
* Enable `StrictMode` to detect all kind of problems

Note that in *[release](app/src/release/java/com/fooock/github/jobs/DefaultApplication.java)* 
mode, we only need to catch `WARNING`s and `ERROR`s, and send it to a crash reporting system.
For this purpose I created the [`CrashLibrary`](app/src/release/java/com/fooock/github/jobs/CrashLibrary.java) class
